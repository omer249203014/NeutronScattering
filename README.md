# NeutronScattering
“This program computes the final energy of a neutron after an elastic collision with a target nucleus. The user provides the target mass number (A) and the scattering angle (theta, in degrees), and the program calculates and displays the neutron’s final energy in MeV. The initial neutron energy is assumed to be 1 MeV.”
